# G-Naira

Background
There is a rising issue concerning the country’s financial sector. To solve this, the government decided to move its financial system to the Blockchain for better transparency and accountability. 

The Task

You were thereby contracted by the Central Bank governor to build a solution to solve these problems leveraging blockchain technologies. The project will be called G-Naira(gNGN). 

The gNGN should consist of the following specifications:
- Compliance with ERC20 standard 
- Minting of new token currency 
- Burning of token currency 
- Blacklisting of addresses to prevent them from sending and receiving tokens 
- There should be an account with the role of ‘GOVERNOR’ - Actions like minting, burning and blacklisting can only be done by the ‘GOVERNOR’ 

Bonus: If you can, add a multi-signature wallet to secure the minting and burning of tokens.
